Smart Meeting Scheduler - Milestone 1

Overview
Milestone 1 marks the beginning of our project, showcasing the integration with the Google Calendar API to access and manage our calendar. For demonstration purposes, we have populated the calendar with dummy data.

Development Environment
Our project was developed using Visual Studio Code, which facilitated the creation of OAuth client ID credentials that were integrated directly into the project files.

Note on Security
Due to time constraints, we were unable to fully implement best practices learned in class regarding the use of service accounts and Streamlit secrets. These methods are crucial for ensuring that sensitive keys are not compromised. Future iterations of the project will prioritize implementing these security measures.

Running the Application
The application runs smoothly within Visual Studio Code. However, please note that once deployed, you may encounter an error related to data leakage prevention. This is an important security feature to be aware of when moving the application to a production environment.

Next Steps
As we progress, we plan to refine our code and enhance security measures. We appreciate your feedback and contributions as we continue to develop the Smart Meeting Scheduler.
